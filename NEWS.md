# dartR.base 1.2.3 (development)

* `gl.drop.ind()`: fixed a bug where locus-metric flags
  (`AvgPIC`, `OneRatioRef`, `OneRatioSnp`, `PICRef`, `PICSnp`, `CallRate`,
  `maf`, `FreqHets`, `FreqHomRef`, `FreqHomSnp`) were only reset to `FALSE`
  after dropping individuals when `verbose >= 2`. At `verbose = 0` or `1`
  with the default `recalc = FALSE`, these flags stayed `TRUE` (stale) even
  though the underlying statistics no longer reflected the retained
  individuals. They now reset correctly at every verbosity level, matching
  the behaviour `verbose >= 2` already had.

* `gl.keep.loc()`: three edge-case fixes. (1) `last` now defaults to the
  last locus in the dataset when omitted, as the documentation always
  stated -- previously `gl.keep.loc(gl, first = 100)` crashed with
  "argument is of length zero". (2) Calling with neither `loc.list` nor
  `first` now fails with a clear parameter error instead of
  "object 'flag' not found". (3) The out-of-range check on the locus range
  previously tested `first` but clamped `last`; an out-of-range `last` now
  warns and clamps as intended, and an out-of-range `first` is now a clear
  fatal error (previously it silently returned a single arbitrary locus).
  Zero-length `loc.list` input still returns the object unchanged with a
  warning, as before.
