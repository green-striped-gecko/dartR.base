# dartR.base 1.2.3 (development)

* `gl.Ho()` / `gl.He()`: the per-locus heterozygosity accessors now
  reject SilicoDArT (presence/absence) data with a fatal error --
  previously they silently returned meaningless values. Documentation
  brought to standard: gl.He's `@return` no longer claims to return
  observed heterozygosity, both functions state their semantics (pooled
  across all individuals; He is plain 2p(1-p) with no sample-size
  correction; NaN for all-NA loci; deliberately silent pure accessors)
  and cross-link gl.alf and gl.report.heterozygosity. Values verified
  exact against hand computation, gl.alf, and the population report.

* `gl.drop.ind()`: fixed a bug where locus-metric flags
  (`AvgPIC`, `OneRatioRef`, `OneRatioSnp`, `PICRef`, `PICSnp`, `CallRate`,
  `maf`, `FreqHets`, `FreqHomRef`, `FreqHomSnp`) were only reset to `FALSE`
  after dropping individuals when `verbose >= 2`. At `verbose = 0` or `1`
  with the default `recalc = FALSE`, these flags stayed `TRUE` (stale) even
  though the underlying statistics no longer reflected the retained
  individuals. They now reset correctly at every verbosity level, matching
  the behaviour `verbose >= 2` already had.

* `gl.keep.ind()`: fixed the identical bug -- the same locus-metric flags
  were only reset to `FALSE` after retaining individuals when
  `verbose >= 2`. Now reset correctly at every verbosity level.

* `gl.report.callrate()`: five fixes. (1) The results tables previously
  printed at every verbosity level including `verbose = 0`; they are now
  gated at `verbose >= 1` (default `verbose = 2` output unchanged).
  (2) The returned object is now truly unaltered, as the documentation
  always stated -- previously it came back with the `CallRate` locus
  metric recalculated in place; the report still uses freshly
  recalculated values internally. (3) An unknown `method` (anything other
  than "loc"/"ind") now warns and coerces to "loc" instead of silently
  producing no output at all. (4) Two documented examples calling a
  nonexistent `by.pop` argument (silently swallowed by `...`) were
  removed. (5) Cosmetic: a stray ")" printed after the individuals table,
  the "3r quartile" typo in both branches, `ind.to.list = 0` listing one
  individual instead of none, and the `@param bins` default documented as
  25 when the signature default is 50.
