# dartR.base (development version)

- `gl.report.hamming()` now reports the exact number of loci that
  `gl.filter.hamming()` would remove at candidate thresholds 0-10, by running
  the filter's own comparison engine in simulation (same worst-to-best
  call-rate ordering). Distances are reported as counts of mismatching bases
  over `min.length` bases, matching the filter's threshold units, and are
  computed in compiled code (the former O(n^2) R loop is gone). Arguments
  `tag.length` and `probar` are deprecated and ignored; a new `min.length`
  argument matches `gl.filter.hamming()`.
- `gl.filter.hamming()` `threshold` is a count of mismatching bases (e.g. 3),
  no longer a proportion of sequence length as in earlier versions;
  proportion-style values (0 < threshold < 1) are rejected with an error.
  Comparable loci are ordered worst-to-best call rate before deduplication,
  so the retained locus of every duplicate pair is the one with the better
  call rate. The comparison engine is shared with `gl.report.hamming()` and
  compiled once per session.
