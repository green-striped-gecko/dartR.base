\title{Calculates N11 distance matrix for individuals defined in N11 dartR
genlight object using binary P/N11 data (SilicoDArT)}
\usage{
utils.dist.binary(
  x,
  method = "simple",
  scale = FALSE,
  swap = FALSE,
  type = "dist",
  verbose = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Name of the genlight containing the genotypes [required].}

\item{method}{Specify distance measure [default simple].}

\item{scale}{If TRUE and method='euclidean', the distance will be scaled to 
fall in the range [0,1] [default FALSE].}

\item{swap}{If TRUE and working with presence-absence data, then presence 
(no disrupting mutation) is scored as 0 and absence (presence of N11 disrupting 
mutation) is scored as 1 [default FALSE].}

\item{type}{Specify the format and class of the object to be returned, 
dist for N11 object of class dist, matrix for an object of class matrix [default "dist"].}

\item{verbose}{Verbosity: 0, silent or fatal errors; 1, begin and end; 2,
 progress log; 3, progress and results summary; 5, full report [default 2].
 
 @details
This script calculates various distances between individuals based on sequence tag
Presence/Absence data.

The distance measure can be one of:
 \itemize{
  \item Euclidean -- Euclidean Distance applied to cartesian coordinates defined
  by the loci, scored as 0 or 1. Presence and absence equally weighted.
 \item simple -- simple matching, both 1 or both 0 = 0; one 1 and the other
 0 = 1. Presence and absence equally weighted.
 \item Jaccard -- ignores matching 0, both 1 = 0; one 1 and the other 0 = 1.
 Absences could be for different reasons.
 \item Bray-Curtis -- both 0 = 0; both 1 = 2; one 1 and the other 0 = 1. Absences
 could be for different reasons. Sometimes called the Dice or Sorensen
 distance.
 \item Sorenson -- both 0 = 0; both 1 = 2; one 1 and the other 0 = 1. Absences
 could be for different reasons. Sometimes called the Dice or Bray-Curtis
 distance.
 }
 One might choose to disregard or downweight absences in comparison with
 presences because the homology of absences is less clear (mutation at one or
 the other, or both restriction sites). Your call.}
