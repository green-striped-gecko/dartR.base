\arguments{
\item{x}{Name of the genlight object containing the SNP or presence/absence

by the global working directory or tempdir()]}

\item{plot.file}{If TRUE, saves any ggplots and listings to the session
temporary directory (tempdir) [default FALSE].}

\item{pbar}{Report on progress. Silent if set to FALSE [default TRUE].}

\item{table}{Prints a tabular output to the console either 'D'=D values, or
'H'=H values or 'DH','HD'=both or 'N'=no table. [default 'DH'].}

\value{
A list of entropy indexes for each level of q and equivalent numbers
 for alpha and beta diversity.
}
\description{
This script takes a genlight object and calculates alpha and beta diversity
for q = 0:2. Formulas are taken from Sherwin et al. 2017. The paper describes
nicely the relationship between the different q levels and how they relate to
population genetic processes such as dispersal and selection.
}
\details{
For all indexes, the entropies (H) and corresponding effective
 numbers, i.e. Hill numbers (D), which reflect the number of needed entities
 to get the observed values, are calculated. In a nutshell, the alpha indexes
 between the different q-values should be similar if there is no deviation
 from expected allele frequencies and occurrences (e.g. all loci in HWE &
 equilibrium). If there is a deviation of an index, this links to a process
 causing it, such as dispersal, selection or strong drift. For a detailed
 explanation of all the indexes, we recommend resorting to the literature
 provided below. Confidence intervals are +/- 1 standard deviation.
\strong{ Function's output }
If the function's parameter "table" = "DH" (the default value) is used, the 
 output of the function is 20 tables.
The first two show the number of loci used. The name of each of the rest of 
the tables starts with three terms separated by underscores.
The first term refers to the q value (0 to 2).
The second term refers to whether it is the diversity measure (H) or its 
transformation to Hill numbers (D). 
The third term refers to whether the diversity is calculated within 
populations (alpha) or between populations (beta). 
In the case of alpha diversity tables, standard deviations have their own 
table, which finishes with a fourth term: "sd".
In the case of beta diversity tables, standard deviations are in the upper 
triangle of the matrix and diversity values are in the lower triangle of the 
matrix.

 Plot colours can be set with gl.select.colors().
 
 If plot.file is specified, plots are saved to the directory specified by the user, or the global
 default working directory set by gl.set.wd() or to the tempdir().
