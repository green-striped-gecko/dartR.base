\title{Calculates a similarity (distance) matrix for individuals on the proportion of
 shared alleles
 @family distance}
\usage{
gl.propShared(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Name of the genlight containing the SNP genotypes [required].}
}
\value{
A similarity matrix
}
\description{
This script calculates an individual based distance matrix. It uses an C++
 implementation, so package Rcpp needs to be installed and it is therefore
  really fast (once it has compiled the function after the first run).
}
\examples{
#takes some time at the first run of the function...
\donttest{
res <- gl.propShared(bandicoot.gl)
res[1:5,1:7] #show only a small part of the matrix
}
}
