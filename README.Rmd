## Overview

`dartR.base` aims to support analysis of SNP data in a spatial context. For example running a least-cost-path analysis or simple isolation by distance plots. There is also a function that calculates spatial autocorrelation.

dartR.base is one of the core packages of the dartRverse. 
Currently the dartRverse consists of the following packages:

-   dartR.base   (report, filter and input/output functions, basic popgen)
-   dartR.data
-   dartR.sim     (functions to simulate SNP data)
-   dartR.spatial (spatial analysis)
-   dartR.popgen (popgen analysis)
-   dartR.sexlinked (identify and filter sexlinked markers)



`dartR` and its packages are a collaboration between the University of Canberra, CSIRO, Diversity Arrays Technology, Arthur Rylah Institute for Environmental Research and Monash University. `dartR` is supported with funding from the ACT Priority Investment Program, CSIRO and the University of Canberra.
